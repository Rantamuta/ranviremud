# RanvierMUD (Discovery Fork)

This repository is a **discovery fork** of the original [RanvierMUD](https://github.com/RanvierMUD/ranviermud) project.

It exists solely to remain visible in the upstream fork network and to help users discover the actively maintained continuation of the project.

## Where active development happens

All current development, maintenance, and releases now live under the **Ranvire** organization:

👉 **https://github.com/Ranvire/ranviermud**

That repository contains:
- a modernized runtime targeting Node.js 22+
- reproducible installs and CI via GitHub Actions
- bug fixes for long-standing crashes and sharp edges
- a restored out-of-the-box experience (clone → install → run → log in)

## What this fork is (and is not)

**This fork is:**
- a pointer for discoverability
- a way to remain connected to the original RanvierMUD network
- intentionally minimal

**This fork is not:**
- the active development repository
- accepting pull requests or issues
- guaranteed to be runnable

If you are looking to use, contribute to, or track the current state of Ranvier, please go to the Ranvire repository linked above.

## Upstream intent

If the original RanvierMUD maintainers wish to merge the maintenance work back upstream, that would be welcome, and assistance will be provided.
